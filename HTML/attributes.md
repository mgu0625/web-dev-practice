## Notes from Sololearn App

Difference between href and src:
- src: source that's non-HTML file
- href: source that is HTML file

"alt" attribute (alternate text): used to add image descriptions

`<img src = "img_boy.jpg" alt="Boy in a Hat">`

When only one of the 2 attributes (ex is giving width but not height) is given, the web browser will calculate the other based on the **aspect ratio** so image is not stretched or squeezed.
